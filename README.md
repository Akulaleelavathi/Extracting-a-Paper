# Extracting-a-Paper


Have you ever taken a picture of a document, only to realize that the background is distracting, or the paper isn't aligned properly? This is a common problem, especially when you need to digitize documents, notes, or any paper-based materials. But fear not! With the power of OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, you can extract the paper cleanly from an image, even if it's slightly skewed or has a busy background. In this blog, we'll walk you through the process of extracting a paper from an image using OpenCV in Python, with easy-to-follow steps and some useful tips. Let's dive in!


Why Extract Paper from an Image?

Imagine you have a photo of a handwritten note or a printed document. You want to digitize it, but the image contains unnecessary elements like a messy desk, shadows, or even parts of your hand. By extracting just the paper, you can:

1)Improve readability and clarity.
2)Enhance the quality for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) applications.
3)Make the document look more professional and neat.
